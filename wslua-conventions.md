## Use contiguous integer keys when Lua sequence semantics are required

Lua reference-table allocation and Lua sequence semantics are different contracts. `luaL_ref()` is appropriate for opaque registry/reference management, but code that relies on table length (`#`) or ordered append/clear behavior should maintain an actual contiguous integer-key sequence instead of depending on implementation details of the reference freelist.

Merged MR !24348, authored and merged by John Thacker, changes WSLua test-library bookkeeping for Lua 5.5 compatibility. The old code used `luaL_ref()` to populate a table and later treated that table as a sequence; changes in Lua's reference freelist behavior made that assumption unsafe. The accepted code explicitly appends entries at consecutive integer indices because the usage is append-only followed by clear-all.

**Implementation rule:** decide whether a Lua table is an opaque reference store or a sequence. If Wireshark code relies on length/order/contiguity, maintain consecutive integer keys directly; do not infer sequence properties from `luaL_ref()` allocation behavior.

**Confidence:** Very high. Merged compatibility fix authored and merged by John Thacker, with the semantic mismatch identified explicitly in the change rationale.
